# Information Retrieval (Spring 2019)

Structured data is easily managed with a relational database but textual information is unstructured and hard to retrieve useful information from due to the difficulty in precisely understanding natural language. In this course, we will introduce various techniques for accessing and mining text information. We will include text processing, inverted indexes, retrieval models (e.g., vector space and probabilistic models), IR evaluation, issues of web search engines, and applications of text retrieval and mining.
